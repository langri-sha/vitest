# Agents orientation — `langri-sha/vitest`

`@langri-sha/vitest` re-exports Vitest, together with `nock` and tempy's
`temporaryDirectory`, so tests import their helpers from one place. The package
is the repository root.

Synthesized files are read-only; change them in `.projenrc.ts`. Repository
settings, branch protection and the Actions secrets are managed by
`langri-sha/github-repos`.

## Common tasks

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm projen                             # re-synthesize from .projenrc.ts
pnpm tsc --build .                      # typecheck
pnpm eslint . && pnpm prettier --check .
pnpm change                             # write a change file
```

There are no tests.

## Vitest is a peer and a devDependency

`vitest` is a peer, so tests run on their consumer's Vitest. It is also a
devDependency at the current release, because the build compiles against its
types: `src/index.ts` re-exports it, so the repository builds against newer
releases as Renovate moves it. `nock` and `tempy` are dependencies, pinned. The
ESLint, Prettier, lint-staged and `@langri-sha/tsconfig` configs come from npm,
pinned too.

## Release

Beachball versions the package and the Release workflow publishes it through npm
trusted publishing. Anything that reaches the tarball or builds it — `src/`,
`readme.md`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.build.json` — needs a change file in the
same pull request. Root tooling does not: `beachball.config.cjs` lists what is
exempt, so lock file maintenance never cuts a release.

The Release workflow calls the shared Packages workflow with
`tag-template: v{version}`, which tags each published version, e.g. `v0.2.0`,
and `github-releases: true`, which creates a GitHub release with generated notes
for it. Beachball's own `gitTags` stays off, since it would name the tags
`@langri-sha/vitest_v0.2.0`. A tag that already has a release is skipped, so the
workflow is safe to rerun.

`main` points at `src/index.ts` in the repository, and `publishConfig` swaps
`main` and `types` for `dist/`, which `prepublishOnly` builds. The tarball ships
`src/` beside `dist/`, which the declaration maps point into, as every release
from `langri-sha/projen` did.

There is deliberately no `engines` field. Published from the root, it would bind
consumers to the Node.js release this repository is developed on, so that lives
in `devEngines`, where `actions/setup-node` reads it.

## Provenance

Extracted from `langri-sha/projen` at `6417104d` on 2026-10-01 with
`git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter packages/vitest`. All 46 commits that
touched the package keep their trees, authorship, dates and messages. The
history reaches back to 2024-06-27, when the package started in
`langri-sha/langri-sha.com`, which handed it to projen on 2026-07-20. Issue and
pull request numbers in those older messages refer to the two source
repositories.
